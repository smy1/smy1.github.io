          <p>The Mayans have a unique way of keeping track of days, in which they count the number of days
            that has passed since the start of a 144,000-day cycle (i.e., 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baktun#:~:text=A%20baktun%20%2F%CB%88b%C9%91%CB%90,equal%20to%20394.26%20tropical%20years." target="_blank"><i>baktun</i></a>).
            When they reach the end of an existing <i>baktun</i>, they move to a new <i>baktun</i> (the world does not end with the 
            end of a <i>baktun</i>). This day-keeping system allows them to identify equinox, the right time in planting 
            corn (their staple food), etc.. At the time of writing this paragraph, the long count is 13.0.11.8.5 
            (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzolk%CA%BCin" target="_blank"><i>Cholq'ij</i></a> date being
            <i>8 Kan</i>). 
          </p>
          <p>There are a number of websites which offer the conversion between a Gregorian date and the Mayan
            long count; however, most of them do not show how the calculation is done. We thus created this little 
            <a href="#">project</a>, to provide open-source scripts (in Python and in R) for those interested in 
            the Gregorian-Long Count conversion. We will also provide fun facts in the conversion program to debunk myths 
            and misunderstandings on the Mayan Long Count.

          <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh" target="_blank"><i>Popol Wuj</i></a> is an ancient Mayan book which
            tells the tale of the origin of mankind and the adventures of 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Hero_Twins" target="_blank"><i>Hunajpu</i> and <i>Xbalamque</i></a> 
            (aka the hero twins). <i>Popol Wuj</i> was originally written in K'iche', a Mayan language, but has since been 
            translated into other languages, notably in Spanish and English. It is often regarded as the Mayan Bible, but 
            many Mayan locals view the book more as the history of their ancestors.
          </p>
          <p>While scholars and translators rightly focus on ensuring that the translation from K'iche' to another language is
            as accurate as possible, there is a need to make the text more accessible to children and for the general 
            public to enjoy the stories as they are. That is why we decided to retell the tales of 
            <i>Popol Wuj</i> in a child-friendly manner and to make the book, <a href="#">The Feathered Serpent</a>, 
            freely available for all to read.
