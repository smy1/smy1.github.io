        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at National Taiwan Normal University, working with 
          <a href="https://scholar.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/en/persons/shinmin-wang/projects/" target="_blank">Prof. Shinmin Wang</a>
          on projects related to shared book reading and children's brain activation. I did my PhD at the University of Nottingham 
          Malaysia Campus under the supervision of 
          <a href="https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/academic/julienma/" target="_blank">Prof. Julien Mayor</a>,
          where I examined word learning strategies that children use. After my PhD, I worked as a post-doctoral researcher at 
          the University of GÃ¶ttingen with 
          <a href="https://www.psych.uni-goettingen.de/en/lang/team/mani-nivedita/mani-nivedita" target="_blank">Prof. Nivedita Mani</a>
          on early language acquisition.

        <h2>From story time to shared book reading</h2>
        <p>When I was very young, my father told me many stories to keep me entertained. This led to my love
          for books and reading. Once I started schooling, I began to hunt around the house for story books that I
          could read. Now, as a working adult with a background in developmental psychology (specialising in 
          language acquisition), I seek to understand the mechanisms behind the benefits of parent-child shared reading. 
          I am also interested in testing the possibility of reducing the academic achievement gap 
          between high and low socioeconomic status (SES) groups through shared reading.
