        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am currently a post-doctoral researcher at National Taiwan Normal University, working with 
          <a href="https://scholar.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/en/persons/shinmin-wang/projects/" target="_blank">Prof. Shinmin Wang</a>
          on shared book reading and children's brain activation. I did my PhD at the University of Nottingham 
          Malaysia Campus under the supervision of 
          <a href="https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/academic/julienma/" target="_blank">Prof. Julien Mayor</a>,
          where I studied the word learning biases in children. I then worked as a post-doctoral researcher at 
          the University of GÃ¶ttingen with 
          <a href="https://www.psych.uni-goettingen.de/en/lang/team/mani-nivedita/mani-nivedita" target="_blank">Prof. Nivi Mani</a>
          on language acquisition in young children before moving to Taiwan.

        <h2>From story time to shared book reading</h2>
        <p>Before I was able to read, my father told me many stories to keep me entertained. This led to my love
          for books and reading. Once I started schooling, I began to hunt around the house for story books that I
          could read. Now, as a working adult with a background in developmental psychology (specialising in 
          language acquisition), I seek to understand the benefits of shared reading especially on children's 
          language development and how this enjoyable activity can narrow the gap between high and low socioeconomic
          status (SES) groups.
