      <h2>Converting between Gregorian dates and the Mayan Long Count</h2>
      <p>The Mayans have a different way in keeping track of days, in which they count the number of days
        that has passed since the start of a 144,000-day cycle (i.e., <i>baktun</i>). When they reach the
        end of the existing <i>baktun</i>, they move to a new <i>baktun</i> (the world does not end with the 
        end of a <i>baktun</i>). This day-keeping system allows them to identify equinox, the right time in 
        planting corn (their staple food), etc.. At the time of writing this paragraph, the long count is 
        13.0.11.8.5 (<i>Cholq'ij</i> date is <i>8 Kan</i>). 
      </p>
      <p>There are a number of websites which offers the conversion between a Gregorian date and the Mayan
        long count, however, most of them do not show how the calculation is done. We thus created this little 
        <a href="#">project</a>, to provide open-source scripts (in Python and in R) for those interested in 
        the Gregorian-Long Count conversion. We also provide fun facts in the conversion program to debunk myths and 
        misunderstandings on the Mayan Long Count.

      <h2>Retelling the stories of <i>Popol Wuj</i></h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popol_Vuh"><i>Popol Wuj</i></a> is an ancient Mayan book which
        tells the tale of the origin of mankind and the adventures of 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Hero_Twins"><i>Hunajpu</i> and <i>Xbalamque</i></a> (aka the hero twins).
        <i>Popol Wuj</i> was originally written in K'iche', a Mayan language, but has since been translated into 
        other languages such as Spanish and English. It is often regarded as the Mayan Bible, but Mayan locals view the
        book more as the history of their ancestors.
      </p>
      <p>While scholars and translators rightly focus on ensuring that the translation from K'iche' to another language is
        as accurate as possible, there is a need to make the text more accessible to children. That is why we decided to
        retell the tales of <i>Popol Wuj</i> in a child-friendly manner and to make <a href="#">our story</a> freely available
        for all to read.
