          <p><br><br><b>How do children learn new words?</b> I am interested in the strategies that children use to resolve 
            referential ambiguity, i.e., how children select referents for novel words. My earlier research focuses on the use of
            Mutual Exclusivity (ME), i.e., the assumption that each object has only one label and thus novel words should be associated
            with novel objects. We found that even when children rely on ME during referent selection, they are 
            still willing to map the novel word to a familiar, name-known object<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2022_me_sia_mayor.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>, 
            <a href="https://osf.io/gdq5z/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>. When syntactic cues such as classifiers are available, 
            children also willingly overrule ME in favour of the syntactic 
            cues<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2021_class_sia_mayor.pdf" target="_blank">3</a></sup>. Other than ME, I 
            also looked at whether and how children make use of word form-meaning systematicity durinng referent 
            selection<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2024_maacke_sia_mather.pdf" target="_blank">4</a></sup>.

          <p><br><br><b>What are the benefits of interactive shared reading?</b> Research has demonstrated that shared 
            reading enhances children's vocabulary size because children are exposed to many new words during reading.
            Shared reading has also been shown to create rich parent-child interaction, which is beneficial to children's
            brain and cognitive development. One of my current projects examines the link between shared reading and 
            children's frontal brain activation (associated with executive function)<sup><a href="https://osf.io/hdumq" target="_blank">ยง</a></sup>.

          <p><br><br><b>How do curiosity and interest shape learning?</b> <i>"Curiosity kills the cat, but satisfaction brings it back".</i> 
            Recent studies have shown that children actively seek out information that they are interested in or are curious
            about. This seems intuitive enough, but we are still trying to unravel the mechanisms behind curiosity, 
            interest, active learning, and children's learning outcome. In one of my projects<sup><a href="https://osf.io/vps7k" target="_blank">ยง</a></sup>,
            we find that the link between active learning and learning outcome is not that straight-forward and may depend 
            on the child's learning preference.

          <p><br><br><b>How much do we know about children from the non-WEIRD population?</b> WEIRD stands for western, educated, 
            industralised, rich, and democratic. This is a very specific group of population and research findings based on
            this group may not hold true for other groups of population. Furthermore, the characteristics "educated" and "rich" 
            (i.e., education and income level, typically used to index SES) mediate the disparity observed in children's 
            later academic achievement. The uniqueness of different languages also means that children's word learning strategy
            will differ depending on what language they 
            speak<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2021_class_sia_mayor.pdf" target="_blank">ยง</a></sup>.
            Given all these pressing issues, I am intrigued in conducting studies to better understand children from
            the non-WEIRD population.
