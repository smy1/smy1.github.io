          <p><br><br><b>How do children learn new words?</b> I am interested in the strategies that children use to resolve 
            referential ambiguity, i.e., how children select referents for novel words. My earlier research focuses on the use of
            Mutual Exclusivity (ME), i.e., the assumption that each object has only one label and thus novel words should be associated
            with novel objects. I found that children are flexible word learners: Even when they rely on ME during referent selection, they are 
            still willing to map the novel word to a familiar, name-known object<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2022_me_sia_mayor.pdf" target="_blank">1</a>, 
            <a href="https://osf.io/gdq5z/" target="_blank">2</a></sup>. I also show that children readily exploit different cues during referent selection, 
            such as classifiers<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2021_class_sia_mayor.pdf" target="_blank">3</a></sup> and 
            word form-meaning systematicity<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2024_maacke_sia_mather.pdf" target="_blank">4</a></sup> 
            (i.e., the assumption that objects that look similar have similar-sounding labels).

          <p><br><br><b>What are the benefits of interactive shared reading?</b> There is general consenses that an interactive form of shared reading 
            is beneficial to children's development. Indeed, one of my recent projects reveals a positive link between interactive shared reading and children's frontal brain 
            activation<sup><a href="https://osf.io/hdumq" target="_blank">1</a></sup>. I am currently running a hyperscanning 
            study<sup><a href="https://osf.io/2sy8p" target="_blank">2</a></sup> in which I measure interpersonal neural 
            synchrony between parents and children during shared reading. My working hypothesis is that neural synchrony should be 
            higher during shared reading than solo reading. Together, these studies demonstrate that parents can shape children's brain development 
            through simple activities such as shared reading.

          <p><br><br><b>How do curiosity and interest shape learning?</b> <i>"Curiosity kills the cat, but satisfaction brings it back".</i> 
            Recent studies have shown that children actively seek out information that they are interested in or are curious
            about. This seems intuitive enough, but we are still trying to unravel the mechanisms behind curiosity, 
            interest, active learning, and children's learning outcome. In one of my projects<sup><a href="https://osf.io/vps7k" target="_blank">ยง</a></sup>,
            I find that children's learning outcome is dependent on their learning preference and whether they felt a sense of agency during learning.

          <p><br><br><b>How much do we know about children from the non-WEIRD population?</b> WEIRD stands for western, educated, 
            industralised, rich, and democratic. This is a very specific group of population and research findings based on
            this group may not hold true for other groups of population. Furthermore, the characteristics "educated" and "rich" 
            (i.e., education and income level, typically used to index SES) mediate the disparity observed in children's 
            later academic achievement. The uniqueness of different languages also means that children's word learning strategy
            will differ depending on what language they 
            speak<sup><a href="./pic/paper/2021_class_sia_mayor.pdf" target="_blank">ยง</a></sup>.
            Given all these pressing issues, I am intrigued in conducting studies to better understand children from
            the non-WEIRD population.
