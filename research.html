      <h1 class="mid">The ABC of children</h1>
      <h2>A for Acquisition</h2>
      <p><b>How do children learn new words?</b> Past research focused a lot of the strategies which children employ
        in order to map a novel word accurately to the intended object referent. In particular, I examined
        children's reliance on word learning biases such as Mutual Exclusity
        <a href="https://tinyurl.com/nk9kaw8m" target="_blank"><sup>§</sup></a> and word form-meaning 
        similarity<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/desc.13444" target="_blank"><sup>§</sup></a> during 
        referent selection. Since children's learning is shaped by their interest towards particular objects, 
        I have also started looking at curiosity-driven learning and active learning
        <a href="https://osf.io/vps7k" target="_blank"><sup>§</sup></a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>B for Books</h2>
      <p><b>What are the benefits of interactive shared book reading?</b> Research has demonstrated that shared 
        reading enhances children's vocabulary size because children are exposed to many new words during reading.
        Shared reading has also been shown to create rich parent-child interaction; hence, together with my current PI, 
        I am investigating the link between shared reading and children's cognitive 
        development<a href="https://osf.io/hdumq" target="_blank"><sup>§</sup></a>.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>C for Community</h2>
      <p><b>How much do we know about children from the non-WEIRD population?</b> WEIRD stands for western, educated, 
        industralised, rich, and democratic. This is a very specific group of population and research findings based on
        this group may not hold true for other groups of population. Furthermore, the characteristics "educated" and "rich" 
        (i.e., education and income level, typically used to index SES) mediates the disparity observed in children's 
        later academic achievement. The uniqueness of each language also means that children's word learning strategy
        will sometimes differ from each other, depending on what language they speak
        <a href="https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/cdev.13401" target="_blank"><sup>§</sup></a>.
        Given all these pressing issues, I am intrigued in contributing to the understanding of children in
        the non-WEIRD population.
