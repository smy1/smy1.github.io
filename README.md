##smy1.github.io

_Super useful tip:_  
1. Site will no longer be visible if the repository is changed to private.  
2. Changing the settings back to public is not enough.  
3. As per https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/23647, we need to push any commit to a page branch to "reactivate" the site.
